    "# 01. Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many definitions for a [regression problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) but in our case, we're going to simplify it to be: predicting a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to:\n",
    "- Predict the selling price of houses given information about them (such as number of rooms, size, number of bathrooms).\n",
    "- Predict the coordinates of a bounding box of an item in an image.\n",
    "- Predict the cost of medical insurance for an individual given their demographics (age, sex, gender, race).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to set the foundations for how you can take a sample of inputs (this is your data), build a neural network to discover patterns in those inputs and then make a prediction (in the form of a number) based on those inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're going to cover\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're going to go through doing the following with TensorFlow:\n",
    "- Architecture of a regression model\n",
    "- Input shapes and output shapes\n",
    "  - `X`: features/data (inputs)\n",
    "  - `y`: labels (outputs)\n",
    "- Creating custom data to view and fit\n",
    "- Steps in modelling\n",
    "  - Creating a model\n",
    "  - Compiling a model\n",
    "    - Defining a loss function\n",
    "    - Setting up an optimizer\n",
    "    - Creating evaluation metrics\n",
    "  - Fitting a model (getting it to find patterns in our data)\n",
    "- Evaluating a model\n",
    "  - Visualizng the model (\"visualize, visualize, visualize\")\n",
    "  - Looking at training curves\n",
    "  - Compare predictions to ground truth (using our evaluation metrics)\n",
    "- Saving a model (so we can use it later)\n",
    "- Loading a model\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if none of these make sense now, we're going to go through each.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How you can use this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read through the descriptions and the code (it should all run), but there's a better option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write all of the code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I'm serious. Create a new notebook, and rewrite each line by yourself. Investigate it, see if you can break it, why does it break?\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to write the text descriptions but writing the code yourself is a great way to get hands-on experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you make mistakes, we all do. The way to get better and make less mistakes is to **write more code**."

A common method is to set your model training for a very long time (e.g. 1000's of epochs) but set it up with an [EarlyStopping callback](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping) so it stops automatically when it stops improving. We'll see this in another module.\n",

    "\n",
    "A common practice when working with neural networks is to make sure all of the data you pass to them is in the range 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practice is called **normalization** (scaling all values from their original range to, e.g. between 0 and 100,000 to be between 0 and 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another process call **standardization** which converts all of your data to unit variance and 0 mean.\n",

    "\n",

    "* Turning all of your data to numbers (a neural network can't handle strings).\n",

    "* [**Feature scaling**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing-scaler):\n",
    "    * Normalizing data (making sure all values are between 0 and 1). This is done by subtracting the minimum value then dividing by the maximum value minus the minmum. This is also referred to as min-max scaling.\n",
    "    * Standardization (making sure all values have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1). This is done by substracting the mean value from the target feature and then dividing it by the standard deviation.\n",
    "    * Which one should you use?\n",
    "      * **With neural networks you'll tend to favour normalization** as they tend to prefer values between 0 and 1 (you'll see this espcially with image processing), however, you'll often find a neural network can perform pretty well with minimal feature scaling.\n",
