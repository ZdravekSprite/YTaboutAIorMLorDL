    "# 02. Neural Network Classification with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, we've seen how to deal with a regression problem in TensorFlow, let's look at how we can approach a classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [classification problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) involves predicting whether something is one thing or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to:\n",
    "* Predict whether or not someone has heart disease based on their health parameters. This is called **binary classification** since there are only two options.\n",
    "* Decide whether a photo of is of food, a person or a dog. This is called **multi-class classification** since there are more than two options.\n",
    "* Predict what categories should be assigned to a Wikipedia article. This is called **multi-label classification** since a single article could have more than one category assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to work through a number of different classification problems with TensorFlow. In other words, taking a set of inputs and predicting what class those set of inputs belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're going to cover\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're going to go through doing the following with TensorFlow:\n",
    "- Architecture of a classification model\n",
    "- Input shapes and output shapes\n",
    "  - `X`: features/data (inputs)\n",
    "  - `y`: labels (outputs) \n",
    "    - \"What class do the inputs belong to?\"\n",
    "- Creating custom data to view and fit\n",
    "- Steps in modelling for binary and mutliclass classification\n",
    "  - Creating a model\n",
    "  - Compiling a model\n",
    "    - Defining a loss function\n",
    "    - Setting up an optimizer\n",
    "      - Finding the best learning rate\n",
    "    - Creating evaluation metrics\n",
    "  - Fitting a model (getting it to find patterns in our data)\n",
    "  - Improving a model\n",
    "- The power of non-linearity\n",
    "- Evaluating classification models\n",
    "  - Visualizng the model (\"visualize, visualize, visualize\")\n",
    "  - Looking at training curves\n",
    "  - Compare predictions to ground truth (using our evaluation metrics)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How you can use this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read through the descriptions and the code (it should all run, except for the cells which error on purpose), but there's a better option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write all of the code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I'm serious. Create a new notebook, and rewrite each line by yourself. Investigate it, see if you can break it, why does it break?\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to write the text descriptions but writing the code yourself is a great way to get hands-on experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you make mistakes, we all do. The way to get better and make less mistakes is to **write more code**."

    "With practice, you'll start to see what kind of hyperparameters work and what don't.\n",

    "Alright, we've trained a bunch of models, but we've never really discussed what's going on under the hood. So how exactly does a model learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "A model learns by updating and improving its weight matrices and biases values every epoch (in our case, when we call the `fit()` fucntion).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If the current patterns (weight matrices and bias values) don't result in a desirable decrease in the loss function (higher loss means worse predictions), the optimizer tries to steer the model to update its patterns in the right way (using the real labels as a reference).\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of using the real labels as a reference to improve the model's predictions is called [**backpropagation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, data and labels pass through a model (**forward pass**) and it attempts to learn the relationship between the data and labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "And if this learned relationship isn't close to the actual relationship or it could be improved, the model does so by going back through itself (**backward pass**) and tweaking its weights matrices and bias values to better represent the data.\n",
